Project Title: Weather Forecast Application

Key Features you can include:

1. Location input: Allow users to enter a city or location for which they want to get the
weather forecast.

2. API Integration: Use a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch current weather
data for the specified location.

3. Display weather data: Present the weather information to the user, including
temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

4. Unit conversion: Provide options for users to choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit for
temperature units.

5. Error handling: Handle cases where the user enters an invalid location or the API request
fails gracefully.
